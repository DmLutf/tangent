# tangent
Python module for finding tangent point from starting point and circle. Will be used in future project.

Uses graphics coordinates with top-left corner as (0, 0).

Having a point be in the circle causes an error, since a tangent cannot go through the circle.

Pygame graphics for demonstration. To run demo, install pygame.
